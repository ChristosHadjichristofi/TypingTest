# Typing Test Challenge
Simple React App where you can test how fast you can type. This project was created with the help of a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNWKVmejuR0&list=PLGyA74h_S9NppHNrzUSjMQbnuHS9jlAcY&ab_channel=TheLeanProgrammer), in order to learn the basics of React.

# API Used
[This](http://metaphorpsum.com/paragraphs/1/9) api was used to retrieve a paragraph. Due to the fact that this api is not an https page and github pages has a problem with this, it was necessary to remove the API call from the project and have a small dataset of paragraphs. Every time a random paragraph from this dataset is served. In the future, I might create my own API for this as a new project.

# Deployment
The app is deployed [here](https://christoshadjichristofi.github.io/TypingTest).
